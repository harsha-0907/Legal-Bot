# Inorder for the streamlit to work, do the following configuration changes

1. Go to the ~/.streamlit/config.toml and add the parameter : enableCORS = false
2. Leave the services running in their native ports.

## The above step is very important so makle sure you do that previous hand( Else the Streamlit will not work)

The Backend will be running in port 89 and the Frontend will be running in port 81


### Difficulties
1. Using Streamlit
2. To persist the jwt token between various pages ->  we cam e up with the plane to store the token in a file.
    2.1. After I thought of this solution, then a thought cam e to my mind that is savin g jwt in localhost means saving in my system, which is the problem itself
    2.2. Use JS to write the token to the local-storage and retrieve it from the local-storage

3. To make the DB modular we had to face many challenges, like re-designing the whole oops approach
