**Conclusion:**

This judgment emphasizes the importance of judicial restraint in issuing interim orders in cases where the matter is still pending before a lower court. The court’s decision highlights the need for the High Court to manage its own proceedings efficiently and to focus on resolving the legal challenges before it, rather than issuing unnecessary directions at the interim stage.  The judgment also reinforces the importance of respecting the autonomy of specialized bodies like the FCI to manage their own selection processes.
