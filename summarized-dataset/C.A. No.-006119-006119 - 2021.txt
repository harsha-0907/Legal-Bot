**6. Reasoning:**

* **Commencement Date of Lease Agreement:** The Supreme Court held that the lease agreement commenced on the date the lease deed was registered (08.11.2011), not on the date the application for the petrol outlet was submitted (11.11.2011).  The court referenced Section 47 of the Indian Registration Act, 1908, which states that a registered document takes effect from the date of registration.
* **Validity of Lease Agreement:** The court found that the lease agreement was validly executed and that the appellant did not have a valid claim to the petrol outlet. The court acknowledged that the appellant had submitted an application for the petrol outlet, but the lease agreement was subsequently granted to another party.
* **Interpretation of Lease Deed:** The court interpreted the lease deed as clearly stipulating that the commencement date of the lease was the date of registration (08.11.2011).  The court noted that the lease deed did not mention the date of the application as the starting point for the lease period.
* **Jurisdiction of the High Court:** The Supreme Court found that the High Court correctly exercised its jurisdiction in examining the findings of the lower court and upholding the validity of the lease agreement.

**7. Statutory Interpretation:**

* The court interpreted Section 47 of the Indian Registration Act, 1908, stating that a registered document takes effect from the date of registration, not from the date of an application.

**8. Precedents Cited:**

* **Jugalkishore Saraf v. Messrs Raw Cotton Co. Ltd., AIR 1955 SC 376:**  The court referenced this judgment to discuss the interpretation of the term "commencement" and the significance of the registration date in lease agreements.

**9. Legal Arguments Accepted/Rejected:**

* **Accepted Arguments:** The respondent’s arguments regarding the validity of the lease agreement and the commencement date based on the registration date were accepted. 
* **Rejected Arguments:** The appellant’s arguments challenging the jurisdiction of the Wakf Tribunal and the validity of the lease agreement were rejected. The appellant’s arguments that the lease agreement was not effective from the date of registration were also rejected.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court’s judgment emphasizes the importance of following proper legal procedures and adhering to the terms of registered agreements in real estate transactions.  The court highlighted that the registration date serves as the definitive starting point for lease agreements. The decision reinforces the role of the High Court in reviewing lower court decisions and ensuring fairness and legal accuracy.
