## Summary of the Judgement in Amitabha Dasgupta v. United Bank of India & Ors.

This case involved a dispute between a locker holder, Amitabha Dasgupta, and United Bank of India (the bank) regarding the bank's alleged negligence in breaking open his locker and the subsequent loss of some of the items deposited inside. The Supreme Court of India addressed the key legal questions arising from the case, emphasizing the need for clear guidelines regarding the responsibilities of banks in managing locker facilities.

**1. Constitutional References:** None explicitly mentioned in the judgment. However, the discussion implicitly involves the application of Article 14 (Right to Equality) and Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty) as the court emphasizes the need to protect the rights of consumers and ensure fairness in the banking system.

**2. Key Legal Questions:**
* Does the bank owe a duty of care to the locker holder with respect to the contents of the locker? 
* Is the bank liable for loss of items from the locker?
* Is the bank subject to the laws of bailment in managing locker facilities? 
* Can the bank claim ignorance of the locker's contents as a defense against liability?
* Does the bank owe a separate duty of care with respect to diligent management and operation of the locker facility, beyond the contents of the locker?

**3. Legal Doctrines:**
* **Bailment:** The judgment delves into the legal doctrine of bailment, examining the relationship between the bank (bailee) and the locker holder (bailor).
* **Negligence:** The court evaluates the bank's liability based on the principle of negligence, considering whether the bank failed to exercise reasonable care in managing the locker facility.
* **Due Diligence:** The court highlights the requirement for banks to exercise due diligence in operating locker facilities, ensuring proper procedures for allotment, operation, and security.
* **Customer Protection:** The judgment emphasizes the importance of protecting the interests of consumers and the need for transparency and fairness in banking practices.

**4. Outcome:**
* The appeal filed by Amitabha Dasgupta was allowed. 
* The judgment and decree of the National Commission dismissing his revision petition were set aside. 
* The judgment and decree of the State Commission were restored.

**5. Reliefs or Orders:**
* The bank was ordered to pay a compensation of Rs. 5,00,000/­ to Amitabha Dasgupta.
* The bank was further ordered to pay Rs. 1,00,000/­ towards litigation expenses.

**6. Reasoning:**
* The court found the National Commission's dismissal of the revision petition was inappropriate due to the bank's undisputed negligence in breaking open the locker without a valid cause and without giving notice to the locker holder.
* The court concluded that the bank’s action was a clear breach of duty of care, amounting to gross deficiency in service, even if the bank lacked knowledge of the exact contents of the locker.
* The court held that the bank’s unilateral disclaimer of liability for the loss of items from the locker was unacceptable, particularly considering the reliance of consumers on bank lockers for safekeeping of valuables.

**7. Statutory Interpretation:**
* The court acknowledged the lack of specific legislation or regulations regarding the liability of banks for loss of articles from lockers under Indian law.
* The court referred to the 2006 and 2007 RBI circulars, acknowledging that the RBI had previously recognized the applicability of bailment principles but had not issued definitive guidelines on the extent of the bank's responsibility. 
* The court also considered the CCI’s observations regarding the common industry practice of banks disclaiming liability for locker contents and the lack of uniformity in their approach.
