**5. Reliefs or Orders:**

* The High Court's dismissal of the appeal was set aside in part.

**6. Reasoning:**

* The Court clarified that a suit for declaration of title and injunction cannot be dismissed solely on the ground that the plaintiff failed to prove possession.
* The Court held that the proviso to Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 applies only if the plaintiff seeks *only* declaratory relief without any consequential relief. 
* The Court found that the plaintiff's claim for injunction, though unsuccessful, prevented the application of the proviso to Section 34.
* The Court disagreed with the High Court's reliance on the decision in Sri Aralappa (supra) and held that the High Court misconstrued the provisions of Section 34.
* The Court held that the principles of Order II Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 were not applicable in this case as the 1987 suit was based on distinct incidents of interference with possession that occurred after the 1982 suit.

**7. Statutory Interpretation:**

* The Court interpreted the provisions of Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, emphasizing the requirement of consequential relief alongside declaratory relief.
