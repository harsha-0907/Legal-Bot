## Summary of the Judgment in Sulochanabai Swaropchand Chawre v. The Additional Commissioner, Amravati Division, Amravati & Ors.

**1. Constitutional References:**

* None explicitly stated. However, the case potentially involves the application of Article 14 (Right to Equality) as it concerns the rights of landowners and the potential for unequal treatment in granting access to property.

**2. Key Legal Questions:**

* Whether the Additional Commissioner's order directing the creation of a road through the appellant's property was justified, especially in the absence of an established easement of necessity or other legal right for the respondent.
* Whether the High Court's order dismissing the appellant's writ petition without adequately addressing the legal issues involved was appropriate. 

**3. Legal Doctrines:**

* **Easement of necessity:** This legal doctrine allows for access to a landlocked property when it is absolutely necessary, but only when established through legal means.
* **Land use regulations:** The judgment implicitly considers the relevant land use regulations and the processes for converting agricultural land to non-agricultural use.

**4. Outcome:**

* The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the High Court's order, and remanded the matter to the High Court for fresh consideration.

**5. Reliefs or Orders:**

* The High Court's order dismissing the appellant's writ petition was set aside.
* The matter was remanded to the High Court for fresh consideration, preferably within six months.
*  The status quo, as it existed on 11.01.2019, was ordered to continue until the High Court's decision, with the caveat that respondent no. 4 would not be allowed to change the character of his property during this period.

**6. Reasoning:**

* The Court found that the High Court's order dismissing the writ petition was too cryptic and did not adequately address the legal issues raised by the appellant, particularly regarding the lack of an established easement of necessity or other right to access.
* The Court emphasized the need for the High Court to delve into the legal arguments and the factual circumstances surrounding the case.
* The Court recognized the potential for a legitimate legal dispute and deemed it necessary for the High Court to properly consider the issues.

**7. Statutory Interpretation:**

* While no specific statute is explicitly interpreted, the Court implicitly relies on the relevant land use regulations and legal framework for granting access to property through easements and other legal avenues. 

**8. Precedents Cited:**

* None explicitly cited.

**9. Legal Arguments Accepted/Rejected:**

* The appellant argued that the High Court’s order was too brief and did not address the key legal issues. This argument was accepted by the Court.
* The appellant argued that there was no legal basis for the Additional Commissioner’s order requiring the creation of a road through their property. The Court did not explicitly accept or reject this argument but deemed it worthy of further consideration by the High Court.
* The respondent argued that they had a legal right to access their property and the High Court’s decision was justified. The Court did not explicitly accept or reject this argument but remanded the case for the High Court to address it.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court's decision highlights the importance of thorough and reasoned judgments by lower courts, especially when dealing with complex legal issues.  The Court emphasized the need for the High Court to examine the legal basis for granting access through a landowner’s property, particularly when the necessity of the easement and the legal rights involved are contested.
