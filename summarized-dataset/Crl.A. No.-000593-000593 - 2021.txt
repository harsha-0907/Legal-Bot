**5. Reliefs or Orders:**

* The court upheld the High Court's decision to quash the FIR against Yogesh Acharya, effectively granting him relief from prosecution.

**6. Reasoning:**

* The court emphasized that Section 197 of CrPC should be interpreted liberally to protect public servants from unnecessary harassment during the discharge of their official duty. 
* The court found that Yogesh Acharya, although not a direct party to the land transaction, was involved in processing and examining documents related to it. 
* The court observed that the complaint alleged a conspiracy and forgery by Yogesh Acharya and other public officials, but the evidence did not establish that the accused acted dishonestly or fraudulently with malicious intent. 
* The court relied on the precedents of *B.S. Saiga & Ors. v. M.S. Kochhar & Ors.* (1985) 2 SCC 638, and *State of Maharashtra v. Dr. Budhikota Subbarao* (2003) 5 SCC 1, to support its broad interpretation of Section 197 of CrPC. 
* The court concluded that, considering the circumstances and the absence of evidence indicating dishonesty or intent to cheat, the prosecution of Yogesh Acharya under Section 197 of CrPC was unjustified. 

**7. Statutory Interpretation:**

* The court interpreted Section 197 of CrPC as a protective measure for public servants, aiming to shield them from unnecessary and frivolous prosecution, even if the acts alleged were committed during their official duty.

* The court accepted the legal arguments put forward by the accused, Yogesh Acharya, and the State of Rajasthan, which argued that the accused was a public servant protected under Section 197 of CrPC.
* The court rejected the arguments presented by the complainant, Indra Devi, who sought to hold Yogesh Acharya liable for the alleged forgery and cheating. 

**Conclusion:**

The judgment ultimately protects Yogesh Acharya, a public servant involved in the land transaction, from prosecution for alleged forgery and cheating. The Supreme Court based its decision on a broad interpretation of Section 197 of CrPC and found that the accused's actions did not constitute a criminal offense deserving of prosecution.
