## Summary of the Judgement in A. Navinchandra Steels Private Limited v. SREI Equipment Finance Limited & Ors.

**1. Constitutional References:** None explicitly mentioned in the judgment.

**2. Key Legal Questions:**
* Does the admission of a winding up petition before the High Court preclude the filing of a petition under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) against the same company?
* Is a Section 7 proceeding under the IBC an independent proceeding, separate from the winding up proceedings?
* Does Section 238 of the IBC, which contains a non-obstante clause, override conflicting provisions of the Companies Act, 1956/2013, including Section 446/279 regarding the initiation of legal proceedings after the admission of a winding up petition?
* Does a sale of the mortgaged property by a secured creditor outside the winding up proceedings constitute an irreversible step that would preclude the transfer of the winding up proceedings to the NCLT?

**3. Legal Doctrines:**
* **Special Statute:** The judgment applies the principle of special statute, recognizing that the IBC is a special statute that prevails over general statutes, including the Companies Act.
* **Non-obstante Clause:** The judgment analyzes the impact of the non-obstante clause contained in Section 238 of the IBC on the application of conflicting provisions in other laws.
* **Independent Proceedings:** The judgment addresses the concept of independent proceedings and how they are treated in relation to other pending legal proceedings.
* **Jurisdiction of NCLT:** The judgment reiterates the jurisdiction of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the IBC, particularly in relation to insolvency proceedings.
* **Secured Creditor's Rights:** The judgment acknowledges the rights of secured creditors to realize their security outside the winding up proceedings.
* **Transfer of Proceedings:** The judgment examines the power of the High Court to transfer winding up proceedings to the NCLT under Section 434(1)(c) of the Companies Act, 2013.

**4. Outcome:**
* The appeal filed by A. Navinchandra Steels Private Limited was dismissed.
* The NCLAT's decision upholding the NCLT's order admitting the petition filed by SREI Equipment Finance Limited under Section 7 of the IBC was affirmed.

**5. Reliefs or Orders:**
* The Appellant's argument that the Section 7 petition was not maintainable due to the pending winding up petition was rejected.
* The NCLT's decision to admit the Section 7 petition was upheld.

**6. Reasoning:**
* The court emphasized that the IBC is a special statute intended to promote the revival of companies in distress, with liquidation being a last resort. The court found that Section 238 of the IBC, with its non-obstante clause, overrides conflicting provisions in the Companies Act, including Section 446/279, which would otherwise bar the initiation of legal proceedings after the admission of a winding up petition.
* The court reiterated that a Section 7 proceeding under the IBC is an independent proceeding that can be initiated regardless of pending winding up proceedings.
* The court rejected the appellant's argument that the sale of the mortgaged property by a secured creditor constituted an irreversible step that would preclude the transfer of the winding up proceedings to the NCLT. The court found that the sale did not necessarily lead to the corporate death of the company, as other assets remained in the hands of the provisional liquidator.
* The court also noted that the Bombay High Court, by its orders dated 28.11.2019 and 23.01.2020, had itself directed the provisional liquidator to hand over the records and assets to the IRP in the Section 7 proceeding, indicating that the High Court recognized the validity of the IBC proceeding.

**7. Statutory Interpretation:**
* The court interpreted Section 7 and Section 238 of the IBC to recognize the independent nature of the IBC proceedings and their overriding effect over the Companies Act.
* The court also interpreted Section 434(1)(c) of the Companies Act, 2013, to acknowledge the discretion of the High Court to transfer winding up proceedings to the NCLT.
