**3. Legal Doctrines:**

* **Charitable Trust:** This refers to a trust established for charitable purposes, with trustees responsible for managing its assets.
* **Sale of Trust Property:** The sale of a charitable trust's property is subject to specific legal requirements aimed at ensuring transparency and maximizing benefits for the trust. 
* **Public Auction:** This is a process where a property is sold to the highest bidder.  
* **Private Negotiations:** This involves the sale of a property through direct negotiations between the seller and buyer. 
* **Legal Necessity:**  This doctrine refers to a compelling reason for the sale of a property, which must be demonstrated to justify the sale of a charitable trust’s property.

* **Procedural Fairness:** This doctrine emphasizes that the process for selling a trust property must be fair and reasonable.  

**4. Outcome:**

* The appeal was allowed.
* The High Court's order dismissing the writ petition and awarding the property to the second respondent was set aside.
* The High Court was directed to re-hear the writ petition after the Charity Commissioner conducts a fresh auction process.

**5. Reliefs or Orders:**

* The appellant’s intervention application was restored to the High Court.
* The Charity Commissioner (third respondent) was ordered to:
    * Obtain a fresh valuation report of the property.
    * Set an upset price of at least Rs 1 crore.
    * Issue a fresh advertisement inviting bids for the property.
    * Consider all bids received, including those from the appellant and second respondent.
    * Submit a report to the High Court with the results of the auction.
* The appellant was directed to move a Civil Application before the High Court to adjust his deposit of Rs 1 crore towards his bid.
* The appellant was granted relief from the High Court's order, which had effectively awarded the property to the second respondent. 

**6. Reasoning:**

* The court examined the legal requirements for selling charitable trust properties, noting that while private negotiations are permitted, they must be conducted in a fair and transparent manner and must be justified by legal necessity. 
* The court found that the Charity Commissioner's initial decision to reject the sale based on the second respondent's offer was justified, as this offer was significantly lower than the property's market value.
* The court accepted the appellant's argument that the High Court erred in dismissing his intervention application without granting him sufficient time to make good his offer of Rs 75 lakhs, especially considering that the second respondent then matched his offer and increased it to Rs 80 lakhs. 
* The court emphasized that a public auction would be the most appropriate method for selling the property, as it would ensure the realization of its true market value and promote transparency. 
* The court expressed concern about the second respondent's progressively increasing bids, which suggested the true value of the property had not been determined. 
* The court, considering the appellant's bona fides and the potential for higher bids, ordered a fresh auction process to be conducted by the Charity Commissioner.

**7. Statutory Interpretation:**

* The court interpreted the Maharashtra Public Trust Act, 1950, particularly Section 36(1) which deals with the sale of trust property. 
* The court emphasized the importance of upholding the principles of transparency and fairness in the sale of charitable trust properties.

**9. Legal Arguments Accepted/Rejected:**

* The court accepted the appellant’s argument that the High Court’s dismissal of his intervention application was unjust, especially considering the second respondent’s increasing bids. 
* The court rejected the second respondent’s argument that the High Court’s order was justified, as it found that the auction process was not conducted fairly and transparently.
