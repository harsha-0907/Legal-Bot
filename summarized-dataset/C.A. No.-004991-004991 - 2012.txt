* Was Respondent No. 2 eligible for the position, given her age exceeded the advertised limit?
* Was the interpretation of the "as far as possible" clause in the scheme as directory correct?
* Was the relaxation of the age limit under SRO 30 of 2003 applicable to the selection process?

**3. Legal Doctrines:**
* **Eligibility Criteria for Public Employment:** The court considered the principles governing eligibility criteria for public employment, emphasizing the need for clear and uniform standards to ensure fairness and prevent arbitrariness.
* **Statutory Interpretation:** The court analyzed the scheme's provisions, particularly the "as far as possible" clause, determining whether it should be interpreted as mandatory or directory.
* **Constitutional Validity of Administrative Actions:** The court examined the constitutionality of the Re-T scheme and the actions of the authorities in light of Articles 14 and 16.

**4. Outcome:**
* The appeal filed by the State of Jammu and Kashmir was partially allowed.
* The High Court order directing the appointment of both candidates was set aside.
* The High Court order directing the appointment of Respondent No. 1 was upheld.
* The High Court order directing the continuance of Respondent No. 2 was set aside.

**5. Reliefs or Orders:**
* Respondent No. 1 was appointed as Re-T teacher, as directed by the High Court.
* Respondent No. 2 was not appointed, as her age exceeded the eligibility criteria.
* The State of Jammu and Kashmir was instructed to accommodate Respondent No. 2 in another suitable vacancy.

**6. Reasoning:**
* The court held that the High Court erred in directing the appointment of both candidates for a single position.
* The court agreed with the High Court that Respondent No. 2 was not eligible for appointment, as her age exceeded the stipulated upper age limit of 35 years as on 01.01.2002.  The court held that SRO 30 of 2003, which relaxed the age limit, was not applicable to this selection process.
* The court found the High Court's interpretation of the "as far as possible" clause in the scheme as directory was incorrect. The court emphasized that interpreting this provision as directory could lead to arbitrary selections and violate Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
* The court acknowledged the precedent set by the case of Iridium Indian Tele-Communication V. Motorola In-Charge but deemed it not applicable to the specific facts of the present case.

**7. Statutory Interpretation:**
* The court interpreted the Re-T scheme, including the eligibility criteria, noting that the scheme allowed the government to relax the age limit for the regularization of Re-T teachers.
