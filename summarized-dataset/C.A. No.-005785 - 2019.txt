* The complaints filed by the apartment buyers were dismissed.

**5. Reliefs or Orders:**

* The National Commission's orders directing the appellant to refund the amounts deposited along with compensation were set aside. 
* The Supreme Court directed the appellant to refund the principal amount deposited by the apartment buyer in Civil Appeal No.3064/2020 within four weeks, with interest at 9% p.a. from 16.09.2019. If the appellant failed to comply, it would be liable to pay default interest at 12% p.a.

* The appellant was directed to not deduct the earnest money or any other amounts from the refund amount, as stipulated in Clause 21.3 of the Agreement.

**6. Reasoning:**

* **Commencement Date of Possession:** The court held that the 42-month period for handing over possession should be calculated from the date of issuance of the Fire NOC, not the date of Building Plan approval, as stipulated by the Agreement and the RERA order. The court emphasized that the Fire NOC was a mandatory requirement for commencing construction, and the Developer had delayed obtaining it. 
* **Unfair Contractual Terms:** The court recognized that the Apartment Buyer's Agreement contained one-sided clauses that were disadvantageous to the buyers, particularly regarding compensation for delay and termination rights.
* **Precedents & Jurisdiction:**  The court acknowledged the precedents set by previous judgments, including IREO Victory Valley Pvt. Ltd. v. Shamshul Hoda Khan and Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Ltd v. Govindan Raghavan, which affirmed the right of apartment buyers to seek redressal for deficiencies in service. However, the court distinguished the present case based on the specific facts and contractual terms.
* **RERA & Consumer Protection Act:** The court did not explicitly state that the RERA Act takes precedence over the Consumer Protection Act, but implicitly applied the provisions of both Acts in analyzing the case. The court acknowledged the RERA’s authority to adjudicate on real estate disputes and emphasized the importance of balancing the competing interests of both parties.

**7. Statutory Interpretation:**

* The court interpreted the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act regarding unfair trade practices and deficiency in service, acknowledging the right of consumers to seek redressal for breaches of contractual obligations.
* The court interpreted the provisions of the RERA Act regarding refund, compensation, and the authority of the RERA to adjudicate on real estate disputes.
* The court interpreted the terms of the Apartment Buyer's Agreement, focusing on the clauses related to the construction-linked payment plan, possession, delay, and termination.
