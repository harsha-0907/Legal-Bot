## Summary of the Judgement in K.N. Nagarajappa & Ors. v. H. Narasimha Reddy

This case involved a dispute over the ownership and possession of three parcels of land (the "suit lands"). The appellants, who had previously been granted occupancy rights over the land, argued that a registered sale deed (Ex.P-1) in favour of the respondents was a nominal one, meant as security for a loan. They also claimed they had an agreement to sell (Ex.D-3), which was not acted upon. 

**1. Constitutional References:** None explicitly mentioned in the judgement.

**2. Key Legal Questions:**
* Was the registered sale deed (Ex.P-1) a genuine or nominal transaction?
* Was the agreement to sell (Ex.D-3) a genuine document?
* Were the appellants in possession of the suit lands?
* Was the first appellate court justified in reversing the trial court's decree?

**3. Legal Doctrines:**
* **Jurisdiction of High Court in Second Appeal:** The judgement examined the High Court's jurisdiction under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which limits the court to reviewing substantial questions of law.
* **Findings of Fact:** The court explored the circumstances under which a High Court can interfere with findings of fact made by the first appellate court.
* **Section 103 CPC:** The court considered the application of Section 103 CPC, which allows the High Court to determine issues of fact in a second appeal under specific circumstances.
* **Promissory Estoppel:** The judgement addressed the doctrine of promissory estoppel, which prevents a party from going back on a promise that was relied upon by another party.
* **Material Considerations:** The court analyzed the weight of material considerations and evidence in determining the validity of the claims.

**4. Outcome:**
* The appeal filed by the appellants was dismissed.
* The High Court's judgment affirming the trial court's decree and rejecting the appellants' claims was upheld.

**5. Reliefs or Orders:**
* No relief was granted to the appellants as the appeal was dismissed.

**6. Reasoning:**
* The High Court found that the trial court had provided convincing and sound reasons for rejecting the appellants' claim based on the agreement to sell (Ex.D-3), which lacked several essential details and showed inconsistencies with the registered sale deed (Ex.P-1).
* The High Court also considered the appellants' application for occupancy rights, which contradicted their claim of a nominal sale deed. 
* The High Court found that the first appellate court had overlooked crucial evidence and misconstrued the record.

**7. Statutory Interpretation:**
* The court interpreted Section 100 CPC and Section 103 CPC, emphasizing that while the High Court's jurisdiction is primarily on questions of law, it can review findings of fact in exceptional cases when the lower court's judgement is based on a perverse appreciation of evidence or overlooks material facts.

* The court accepted the High Court's reasoning that the first appellate court had overlooked material evidence and made a perverse appreciation of the facts.
