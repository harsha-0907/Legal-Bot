## Summary of the Supreme Court Judgment in Kaloji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences v. Srikeerti Reddi Pingle & Ors. 

**1. Constitutional References:** The judgment does not explicitly cite any specific articles from the Constitution of India. However, the case involves the interpretation of regulations framed by the Medical Council of India (MCI), which are enacted under the authority of the Indian Constitution.

**2. Key Legal Questions:** 
- Whether the student, Srikeerti Reddi Pingle, met the eligibility criteria for admission to the MBBS course, specifically regarding the requirement of studying Biology/Biological Sciences at the 10+2 or equivalent level.
- Whether the University acted arbitrarily in rejecting the student's application based on the equivalence certificate issued by the Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education.
- Whether the interpretation of the MCI Regulations by the Madras High Court in earlier cases was correct.

**3. Legal Doctrines:**
- **Statutory Interpretation:** The court interpreted the provisions of the Medical Council of India Regulations on Graduate Medical Education, 1997 (MCI Regulations).
- **Arbitrary Action:** The court examines whether the University's action in rejecting the student's application was arbitrary.
- **Equivalence of Qualifications:** The court evaluates the equivalence of the student's qualifications from the US with the 10+2 requirement in India.

**4. Outcome:** The appeal was allowed. The Supreme Court set aside the High Court's order and upheld the University's decision to reject the student's application.

**5. Reliefs or Orders:** The impugned order of the High Court was set aside. The appeal was allowed without order on costs.

**6. Reasoning:** 
- The court analyzed the relevant provisions of the MCI Regulations, highlighting the emphasis on the candidate's study of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology/Biotechnology at the 10+2 or equivalent level.
- The court found that the student's course at Conrad High School in the 10th grade and the Advanced Placement (AP) Biology course, while challenging, did not meet the requirement of completing two years of study in Biological Sciences at the 10+2 level.
- The court clarified that the Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education's equivalence certificate merely alluded to the general equivalence at the intermediate level without confirming equivalence in terms of specific subjects.
- The court rejected the interpretation of the Madras High Court in earlier cases that each sub-clause of the MCI Regulations should be read independently, highlighting the need for a holistic understanding of the requirements for eligibility.

**7. Statutory Interpretation:** The court interpreted the MCI Regulations to conclude that the requirement to have studied Physics, Chemistry, and Biology/Biotechnology at the 10+2 level is not merely a formality but an essential requirement for eligibility in the MBBS course.

**8. Precedents Cited:**
- Sharanya Balaji Nadar v. The Dental Council of India (W.P.Nos.32099/2019 & WMP 32352 & 32353/2019 dated 14.07.2020)
- Kashvi Udhayakumar v. Union of India (WP Nos. 16529 & 16534/2020 & WMP 20510, 20512, 20517 and 20515/2020 dated 01.12.2020)
- State of Bombay v. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala (1957 SCR 930)

**9. Legal Arguments Accepted/Rejected:** 
- The court accepted the University's argument that the student's qualifications did not meet the eligibility criteria for the MBBS course.
- The court rejected the student's argument that the equivalence certificate and the letters from Conrad High School established her eligibility, finding those documents insufficient to prove two years of study in Biology/Biological Sciences.
