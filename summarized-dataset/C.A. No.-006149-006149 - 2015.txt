* **Article 226:**  The High Court’s jurisdiction to issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights was invoked by the plaintiff.
* **Article 227:** The High Court’s jurisdiction to exercise superintendence over subordinate courts was also invoked by the plaintiff.

* **Validity of Tenancy Surrender:** Whether the surrender of tenancy by Devendra Prasad Sinha (defendant No. 1) to the Wakf Board was valid, considering his status as Karta of the joint Hindu family.
* **Joint Hindu Family Business:**  Whether the hotel business carried out by the plaintiff's ancestors was a joint Hindu family business, necessitating consent from other coparceners for surrender of tenancy.
* **Applicability of Hindu Law:** Whether personal law regarding devolution of joint Hindu family property applies to tenanted property.

* **Hindu Law:** The court analyzed the principles of Hindu law regarding joint Hindu family property and the powers of the Karta.
* **Estoppel:** The court applied the principle of estoppel, holding that the parties were bound by the previous judicial order transferring the suit to the Wakf Tribunal.

* **Writ Jurisdiction:** The court reviewed the scope and limitations of the High Court’s jurisdiction under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution.

**4. Outcome:**

* The Supreme Court allowed the appeal filed by the appellant (Kiran Devi) and set aside the judgment of the Patna High Court.
* The order of the Wakf Tribunal dismissing the plaintiff’s suit for declaration as tenant was restored.

**5. Reliefs or Orders:**

* The High Court’s order directing the dispossession of the appellant from the suit premises and handing over possession to the plaintiff was set aside.

**6. Reasoning:**

* **Jurisdiction of Wakf Tribunal:** The Supreme Court held that the Wakf Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear the suit, considering the previous judicial order transferring it from the Civil Court. The parties were estopped from challenging the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, having accepted the transfer order and proceeded to trial. 
* **Validity of Tenancy Surrender:** The court found that the surrender letter, though disputed by the plaintiff, was validly proved and accepted by the Wakf Board and the executor of the surrender letter. 
* **Joint Hindu Family Business:**  The Supreme Court held that the plaintiff failed to prove that the hotel business was a joint Hindu family business.  The mere fact that the plaintiff's ancestors carried out business in the tenanted premises did not establish that the business was conducted for and on behalf of the joint Hindu family.
* **Applicability of Hindu Law:**  The court rejected the plaintiff’s argument that personal law regarding devolution of joint Hindu family property applied to tenanted property. The court acknowledged that the tenancy was an individual right vested with the plaintiff's grandfather and that he was competent to surrender it.

**7. Statutory Interpretation:**

* The court interpreted the provisions of the Wakf Act, 1995, particularly Section 83 and its proviso, regarding the jurisdiction of the High Court to examine the legality of decisions by the Wakf Tribunal.
* The court interpreted the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, regarding unfair trade practices and deficiency in service, in the context of the appellant's argument that the agreement contained unfair terms.
