* The writ petition filed by the respondent was dismissed.

**5. Reliefs or Orders:**

* The High Court's order directing the IIT to re-evaluate the respondent's candidature and allow him to register for the JEE (Advanced) was set aside. 

**6. Reasoning:**

* **Deference to IIT's Admission Criteria:** The Supreme Court held that the High Court was incorrect in overturning the IIT's decision regarding Criterion 5. The court emphasized that courts should exercise caution and deference when reviewing decisions made by academic institutions, particularly those of national importance, such as IITs.
* **Public Policy Considerations:** The court accepted the IIT's argument that Criterion 5 was based on sound public policy considerations. The court found that the IIT’s goal was to ensure the efficient allocation of valuable seats and to encourage students to improve their performance and secure a more desirable position. 
* **Procedural Fairness:** The court found that the IIT’s admission process, which allowed for a limited period for withdrawal after securing a seat, was procedurally fair. The court acknowledged that the respondent had been offered a seat in IIT Kharagpur and had accepted it, even though he later secured a seat at IIT Bombay. The court noted that the respondent had not followed the prescribed procedure for withdrawal after securing a seat at IIT Kharagpur. 

**7. Statutory Interpretation:**

* The court interpreted the Institutes of Technology Act, 1961, and the JEE (Advanced) Information Brochure, acknowledging the IIT’s authority to set admission criteria and the importance of maintaining a fair and efficient examination process.
* The court also analyzed the Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) Business Rules, particularly those governing seat allocation and withdrawal procedures.

**8. Precedents Cited:**

* **All India Council for Technical Education v. Surinder Kumar Dhawan (2009) 11 SCC 726:**  The court cited this case to emphasize the principle of deference to expert bodies in academic matters.
* **Basavaiah (Dr.) v. Dr. H.L. Ramesh & Ors. (2010) 8 SCC 372:** This case was cited to emphasize the need for courts to defer to the recommendations of expert committees in academic settings. 
* **State of UP v Harish Chandra & Ors. (1996) 9 SCC 309:** This case was referenced to support the argument that the rule requiring litigants to exhaust all appellate remedies before approaching the Supreme Court is a rule of convenience, not a strict requirement.
* **Sidhant Batra v. Director IIT Bombay CA 4029/2020:** This case was cited to highlight the IIT's position regarding the respondent's admission in IIT Bombay.

**9. Legal Arguments Accepted/Rejected:**

* **Accepted Arguments:** The IIT's arguments that Criterion 5 was based on sound public policy considerations, that the respondent had not followed the prescribed withdrawal procedure, and that the High Court was not justified in interfering with the IIT’s admission process were accepted. 
* **Rejected Arguments:** The respondent’s argument that Criterion 5 was discriminatory and arbitrary and that the IIT’s admission process was unfair were rejected.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court’s judgment clarifies the legal framework governing admission processes for institutions of national importance, such as IITs, and the court’s role in reviewing academic decisions. The court recognized the IIT’s authority to set admission criteria based on sound public policy and procedural fairness. The decision highlights the importance of adhering to established rules and procedures in competitive examination processes.
