## Summary of the Judgment in Chairman, Food Corporation of India & Anr. Etc. v. Manoj Kumar Srivastava & Ors. Etc.

**1. Constitutional References:**

* None explicitly stated. However, the case potentially involves Article 14 (Right to Equality) as it concerns the selection process for government jobs and the potential for unfair treatment of candidates based on their qualifications.

**2. Key Legal Questions:**

* Whether the High Court's interim order directing the Food Corporation of India (FCI) to verify the eligibility of candidates for Assistant General Manager (Legal) posts was justified.
* Whether the High Court's order to create a chart demonstrating the eligibility of candidates based on evidence submitted after the initial application process was appropriate.
* Whether the FCI's rejection of the respondent's application due to his failure to provide specific details about his legal experience was justified.

**3. Legal Doctrines:**

* **Statutory Interpretation:** The court analyzed the relevant criteria for the Assistant General Manager (Legal) posts as advertised by the FCI.
* **Administrative Law:** The judgment implicitly deals with principles of administrative law, specifically the role of courts in reviewing administrative decisions and the use of interim orders. 
* **Principles of Natural Justice:** The Court considered the principles of fair play and procedural fairness in its reasoning.

**4. Outcome:**

* The Supreme Court disposed of the appeals, upholding the interim stay order issued earlier and directing the High Court to expedite the pending writ petitions. 

**5. Reliefs or Orders:**

* The Supreme Court's interim stay order on the High Court's directions was maintained.
* The High Court was requested to dispose of the pending writ petitions as early as possible, preferably within six months.

**6. Reasoning:**

* The Court found that the High Court's interim directions were not necessary, as the matter was already pending before the High Court for a significant period (10 years). 
* The Court noted that the FCI's decision to reject the respondent's application was based on his failure to provide evidence of the required legal experience, which was explicitly mentioned in the advertisement. 
* The Court acknowledged the right to procedural fairness, but held that the High Court's directions to create a chart and collect evidence after the initial application process were not justified.  
* The Court acknowledged that the High Court had already issued a stay order on the FCI's decisions, and therefore, no further interim relief was required.

**7. Statutory Interpretation:**

* The Court interpreted the advertisement for the Assistant General Manager (Legal) posts, specifically the criteria for legal experience, as being clear and unambiguous.

**8. Precedents Cited:**

* None explicitly cited.

**9. Legal Arguments Accepted/Rejected:**

* The appellants argued that the High Court's directions were inappropriate and not justified. This argument was implicitly accepted by the Court. 
* The respondent argued that the High Court's directions were necessary to ensure fairness in the selection process. This argument was implicitly rejected by the Court.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court's decision highlights the importance of balancing the need for fairness in administrative processes with the efficiency and timeliness of legal proceedings. The Court emphasized that courts should be cautious in issuing interim orders, especially when there is a history of delays in the case. The judgment also reinforced the importance of  following the clear criteria established in job advertisements and the potential consequences of failing to do so.
