**Conclusion:**

This judgment emphasizes the importance of judicial restraint in reviewing administrative decisions related to public service recruitment. The court's decision reinforces the principle that the High Court should not interfere in the decision-making process of specialized bodies like the UPPSC unless there is clear evidence of procedural flaws or a violation of fundamental principles of fairness. The court’s decision underscores the need for the High Court to respect the autonomy of the UPPSC in managing the selection process.
