## Judgment Summary: Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC v. Future Retail Limited & Ors. 

**1. Constitutional References:**

* None explicitly cited. However, the judgment implicitly touches upon Article 14 (Right to Equality) when discussing the need for a level playing field and fair treatment for parties in legal disputes.

**2. Key Legal Questions:**

* Can an "award" delivered by an Emergency Arbitrator under the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) Rules be considered an "order" under Section 17(1) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (Arbitration Act)? 
* Is an order passed under Section 17(2) of the Arbitration Act, enforcing an Emergency Arbitrator's award, appealable?

**3. Legal Doctrines:**

* **Statutory Interpretation:** The court focused on interpreting the meaning and application of Sections 2, 9, 17, and 37 of the Arbitration Act, specifically examining the definitions of "arbitration," "arbitral award," and "arbitral tribunal" in relation to Emergency Arbitrator awards.
* **Party Autonomy:** The court emphasized the principle of party autonomy in arbitration, allowing parties to agree to institutional rules, including those providing for Emergency Arbitrator appointments. 
* **Legal Fiction:** The court analyzed the concept of legal fiction as used in Section 17(2), acknowledging its limited purpose for enforcement and cautioning against extending it to encompass appeals.

**4. Outcome:**

* The appeals were dismissed.
* The impugned judgments of the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court, dated 8th February, 2021 and 22nd March, 2021 were set aside.
* The interim orders of the Supreme Court were vacated.

**5. Reliefs or Orders:**

* The Supreme Court revoked the High Court's stay orders on the Single Judge's judgment.
* The Supreme Court vacated its own interim orders. 

**6. Reasoning:**

* The court found that an Emergency Arbitrator's "award," under the SIAC Rules, is an order under Section 17(1) of the Arbitration Act.  The court argued that the definition of "arbitral proceedings" in the Act is broad enough to encompass emergency arbitration proceedings, which commence after a notice of arbitration is received by the SIAC Registrar.
* The court determined that enforcement orders under Section 17(2) are not appealable under the Arbitration Act, but rather fall under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, making appeals possible under Order XLIII, Rule 1(r) of the Code. 
* The court emphasized that the principle of party autonomy in arbitration allows parties to agree to institutional rules, including those providing for Emergency Arbitrators. This means that the Arbitration Act, when read with the institutional rules, covers Emergency Arbitrator orders.
* The court rejected arguments that the Emergency Arbitrator is not an independent judicial body or that the Arbitration Act operates as an ouster of the civil court's jurisdiction, arguing that the Act is intended to promote arbitration as a means of resolving disputes and does not exclude Emergency Arbitrator appointments.
* The court also rejected the argument that the use of "as if" in Section 17(2) creates a legal fiction that encompasses appeals, arguing that the fiction is meant for enforcement only. 

**7. Statutory Interpretation:**

* The court interpreted the definition of "arbitration" in Section 2(1)(a) of the Arbitration Act to cover any arbitration, including those administered by permanent arbitral institutions.
* The court interpreted "arbitral proceedings" in Section 17(1) to encompass proceedings before an Emergency Arbitrator, as long as the parties agree to the institutional rules governing such proceedings.
* The court interpreted Section 37 of the Arbitration Act as a complete code for appeals related to arbitration, excluding appeals from enforcement orders made under Section 17(2).

* The court accepted Amazon's argument that an Emergency Arbitrator's award falls within the scope of Section 17(1) of the Arbitration Act when parties agree to institutional rules like the SIAC Rules.
* The court accepted Amazon's argument that enforcement orders under Section 17(2) are not appealable under the Arbitration Act and are instead governed by the Code of Civil Procedure. 
* The court rejected FRL's arguments that Emergency Arbitrator awards are outside the Arbitration Act, that the Arbitration Act functions as an ouster of the civil court's jurisdiction, and that the legal fiction in Section 17(2) should be extended to cover appeals. 
* The court rejected the argument that the SIAC Rules exclude Emergency Arbitrators, finding that the Rules expressly cover such awards.
* The court rejected the argument that the parties' agreement makes the SIAC Rules subject to the Arbitration Act in a way that would exclude Emergency Arbitrators.
