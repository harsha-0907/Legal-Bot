**6. Reasoning:**

* The Court emphasized that the appellant’s responsibility was limited to inspecting and certifying the quality and quantity of the groundnut at the time of shipment from India. 
* The Court found that the appellant's disclaimer in the certificates, absolving them of responsibility for changes during transportation and storage, was valid and reflected the inherent risks associated with shipping agricultural products.

* The Court emphasized the burden of proof lying on the complainant to establish deficiency in service under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
