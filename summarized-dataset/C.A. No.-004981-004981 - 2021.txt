## Summary of the Judgement in Union of India & Ors. v. M/s Puna Hinda

This case involved an appeal by the Union of India (appellant) against a Gauhati High Court order that dismissed an intra-court appeal and upheld a Single Bench decision to require the Union of India to pay M/s Puna Hinda (respondent) a substantial sum of money related to a road construction project. The dispute centered on the validity of the joint survey report, the interpretation of contract terms, and the appropriate forum for resolving the dispute.

* **Arbitration Clause:** The court considered the existence of an arbitration clause in the contract and its implications for the jurisdiction of the court.

**4. Outcome:**

**6. Reasoning:**

* The court held that the dispute was primarily a matter of contractual interpretation and not a public law issue, rendering the writ petition inappropriate.
