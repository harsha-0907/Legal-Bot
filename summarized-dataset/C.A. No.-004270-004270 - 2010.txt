**4. Outcome:**

**5. Reliefs or Orders:**
* The High Court's judgment and decree were reversed.
* The Trial Court's judgment and decree were restored.

**6. Reasoning:**
* The court found that the High Court's judgment lacked sufficient reasoning for reversing the Trial Court's judgment. The court held that an Appellate Court, particularly when reversing a Trial Court's decision, is obligated to provide detailed reasons for doing so, demonstrating a conscious application of mind to the findings and contentions presented.
* The court examined the suspicious circumstances surrounding the execution of the will, including the testator's ill health, the close proximity between the date of execution and his death, the lack of evidence regarding the scribe, and the discrepancy in the testimonies of the attestors. The court found that the respondents-plaintiffs had failed to dispel these suspicions with convincing evidence.
* The court held that the will (Ex-P1) did not meet the requirements of a valid testament in the eye of the law.

**7. Statutory Interpretation:**
* The court interpreted Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, to require the testator to sign the will with the intention of giving effect to it, and to comply with the requirements of attestation by two or more witnesses.
* The court interpreted Section 68 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, to mandate the examination of at least one attesting witness to prove the execution of the document.
