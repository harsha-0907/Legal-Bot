**6. Reasoning:**

* **Date of Death:** The Supreme Court conducted an inquiry into the date of death of Kuladhara Tanty, considering the conflicting evidence presented by the parties. Based on the inquiry, the court accepted the report of the District & Sessions Judge, Sundargarh, finding that the death occurred on 14.07.1993. 
* **Inheritance Rights:** The court held that based on the established date of death of Kuladhara Tanty, the appellant was a legal representative and heir of the deceased landholder and, therefore, entitled to 50% of the compensation.
* **Procedural Fairness:** The court found that the High Court had erred in setting aside the trial court’s decision without a proper consideration of the evidence and procedural fairness. The High Court’s decision was based on a single application for amendment and did not adequately examine the available evidence, including the death certificate and the report from the District & Sessions Judge.

**7. Statutory Interpretation:**

* The court interpreted Section 30 of the Land Acquisition Act, clarifying the distribution of compensation among legal heirs of the deceased landholder.

**8. Precedents Cited:**

* **Rejected Arguments:** The respondent’s argument that the High Court was justified in rejecting the death certificate and other evidence was rejected. The respondent’s argument that the appellant’s application for amendment was infructuous was also rejected. 

**Conclusion:**

This judgment highlights the importance of a fair trial process and the need for courts to properly consider all available evidence before reaching a decision. The court emphasized the principle of due process and the right of all parties to a fair hearing.  The decision to conduct a separate inquiry into the date of death demonstrates the court’s commitment to ensuring factual accuracy and legal clarity in property disputes.
