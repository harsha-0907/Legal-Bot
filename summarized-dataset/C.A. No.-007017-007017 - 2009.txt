## Judgment Summary: Prabhagiya Van Adhikari Awadh Van Prabhag v. Arun Kumar Bhardwaj (Dead) thr. LRs. & Ors.

**1. Constitutional References:**

* None explicitly cited. However, the judgment implicitly touches upon Article 14 (Right to Equality) when discussing the need for fair treatment of parties in legal disputes.

**2. Key Legal Questions:**

* Did the land in question (Khasra No. 1576) legally vest with the Forest Department by virtue of the notifications issued under the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 (Abolition Act) and the Indian Forest Act, 1927 (Forest Act)? 
* Did the Gaon Sabha have the legal right to grant a lease of the land to the respondents, considering the notifications issued under the Abolition Act and the Forest Act? 
* Was the Deputy Director of Consolidation correct in setting aside the earlier order that had dismissed the Forest Department's claim to the land? 

**3. Legal Doctrines:**

* **Statutory Interpretation:** The court focused on interpreting the provisions of the Abolition Act, the Forest Act, and the U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953 (Consolidation Act).
* **Land Ownership and Title:** The court examined the legal principles governing land ownership and the legal effect of notifications under the relevant Acts. 
* **Revenue Records and Title:** The court addressed the weight given to revenue records in determining land ownership, emphasizing that they do not, in themselves, confer title.

**4. Outcome:**

* The appeal was allowed.
* The High Court's order setting aside the Deputy Director's order was set aside.
* The Deputy Director's order was restored, confirming the land's vesting with the Forest Department.

**5. Reliefs or Orders:**

* The Supreme Court reversed the High Court's order and restored the Deputy Director's order.
* The land in question (Khasra No. 1576) was confirmed as belonging to the Forest Department.

**6. Reasoning:**

* The court found that the notification dated 11.10.1952 under Section 4 of the Abolition Act vested the land in the State, and no subsequent general or special order transferred it to the Gaon Sabha.
* The court upheld the notification dated 23.11.1955 under Section 4 of the Forest Act, which declared the land as a protected forest. The court found that the notification met the procedural requirements of Section 4 and that the respondents had no right to the land at the time of the notification. 
* The court held that the proclamation issued under Section 6 of the Forest Act, which specified Khasra No. 1576, further solidified the land's status as a protected forest.
* The court emphasized that the Gaon Sabha was not legally competent to grant a lease to the respondents after the land was declared as a protected forest. 
* The court rejected the respondents' argument that the Forest Department's objections were barred by Section 49 of the Consolidation Act. 

**7. Statutory Interpretation:**

* The court interpreted the provisions of the Abolition Act and the Forest Act to establish the Forest Department's ownership of the land, based on the legal effect of the notifications and the absence of subsequent legal transfers. 
* The court found that Section 5 of the Forest Act barred the acquisition of any rights to the land after the notification was issued under Section 4.
* The court emphasized that revenue records are not conclusive evidence of title and that the respondents had no legal basis for their claim to the land.

**8. Precedents Cited:**

* *State of U.P. v. Dy. Director of Consolidation & Ors.* (1996) 5 SCC 194

* *Prahlad Pradhan & Ors. v. Sonu Kumhar & Ors.* (2019) 10 SCC 259

**9. Legal Arguments Accepted/Rejected:**

* The court accepted the appellant's argument that the notifications under the Abolition Act and Forest Act legally vested the land in the Forest Department.
* The court rejected the respondents' argument that the notification under Section 4 of the Forest Act was vague and did not comply with the requirements of the Act.
* The court rejected the respondents' argument that the Gaon Sabha was legally entitled to grant a lease after the land was declared as a protected forest.
* The court rejected the respondents' argument that the Forest Department's objections were barred by Section 49 of the Consolidation Act.
