**6. Reasoning:**

* **Apportionment of Negligence:** The Supreme Court held that the High Court had erred in overturning the MACT’s apportionment of negligence.

However, the Supreme Court noted that the MACT had failed to properly consider the deceased’s future earning potential by failing to include factors such as his age, qualifications, and career prospects. The Supreme Court held that the MACT should re-evaluate the deceased’s future earning potential and determine a more accurate compensation amount.
